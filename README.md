# Sports Revenue Optimization

This project investigates the product information of an online sportswear company with the primary goal of developing strategies to increase its income.
The data, which includes details about pricing, discounts, revenue, ratings, reviews, product descriptions, and website traffic, is stored across multiple tables and was loaded into MySQL using a Python script on Online_Sport_Data_to_Mysql.py

The project aimed to answer numerous critical queries and examined a variety of SQL concepts including table joins, data aggregation, correlation analysis, and handling date and time data.
The SQL steps used in this project are included in the Online_Sports_Retail.sql file.:

1. **How do the price points of Nike and Adidas products differ?**
2. **Is there a difference in the amount of discount offered between the brands?**
3. **Is there any correlation between revenue and reviews? And if so, how strong is it?**
4. **Does the length of a product’s description influence a product’s rating and reviews?**
5. **Are there any trends or gaps in the volume of reviews by month?**
6. **How much of the company’s stock consists of footwear items? What is the average revenue generated by these products?**
7. **How does footwear’s average revenue differ from clothing products?**
